# ETL-Shell-Script-with-PostgreSQL-Access-Log-Processing
This project demonstrates an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process using a shell script to manage access logs. The script will download a gzipped file, extract relevant data, transform it into CSV format, and load it into a PostgreSQL database.
